# E-commerce-Churn-Prediction

## Overview 

Customer churn - also known as customer attrition – is when a customer stops using/buying your products or services.

It’s a measure of the number of customers leaving a business over a specific period of time. 

Customer churn is something that every business has to deal with because customers always come and go, but if churn is left unchecked, it can greatly impact your revenue in the long run.

Build a model that determines whether or not a customer churns.

## Project Deliverables

1. Define the question, the metric for success, the context, experimental design taken.

2. Read and explore the given dataset.

3. Define the appropriateness of the available data to answer the given question.

4. Find and deal with outliers, anomalies, and missing data within the dataset.

5. Perform univariate, bivariate recording your observations.

6. Performing *Random forest, Gradient Boost and SVM*

7. Challenging the Solution using *KNN*

8. Conclusion

9. Recommendations 

## Models Performed
